		<h3>Open Robotics Research Positions</h3><br>
        <p style="text-align: justify">We invite applications for several postdoctoral fellow <span class="grid_14"> and Ph.D. positions  in the Biomechatronics  and Intelligent Robotics Lab of the Mechanical Engineering Department at the 
        <a href="https://www.ccny.cuny.edu"> City University of New York, City College (CCNY)</a></span>. <strong> The postdoc position is jointly affiliated with CCNY and National Institutes of Health (NIH) </strong>. The postdoc and Ph.D. students  will work with <a href="https://haosu-robotics.github.io"> Prof. Hao Su</a> to design and develop control algorithms for <strong>soft wearable robots and surgical robots</strong>.  The projects include high-performance actuator modeling and control, soft wearable robots for rehabilitation, vision-guided robots for minimally invasive surgery, and etc. Our work is in collaboration with National Institutes of Health (NIH), Harvard University and several top medical schools in the United States. The  candidates can  work with our <a href="https://www.zahncenternyc.com">Zahn Innovation Center</a>, a startup incubator that  has created $6M startups' revenue and 100 internships and the <a href="https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/bme/nycbe">New York Center for Biomedical Engineering</a> (NYCBE). NYCBE is a consortium of New York City medical research institutions established in 1994 to serve as a focal center for collaborative biomedical engineering research in the New York metropolitan area. Partner Institutions include Columbia University, Hospital for Special Surgery, New York University, and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. Located in Manhattan, CCNY is as diverse, dynamic and visionary as New York City itself.</span> Applications (assembled as a single PDF file) should contain a  CV, a  list of publications, all transcripts, and copies of up to five relevant scientific papers. Applications should be emailed to Hao Su (hao.su at ccny.cuny.edu). </p><br>
        
<p align="justify" ><strong>Postdoc fellows</strong> (available now)</p><br>
  
<p><strong>Position #1</strong>: Mechanical design of soft robots, including wearable robots for patients with impairments and steerable surgical robots. Experience in actuator design, cable transmission, series elastic actuators, electric motors, or pneumatics is a plus.  </p><br>
<p align="justify"><strong>Position #2</strong>: Developing force and position control algorithms for our soft exoskeleton robot and soft  bi-manual humanoid robot. Experience in impedance control and haptics is a plus. This is a great opportunity to lead a new research direction on a new generation of wearable robot and humanoid robot platforms with several PIs who have expertise in mechatronics, computer vision, and machine learning.  </p><br>
<p align="justify">A Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, or a related field is required. Candidates will be expected to carry out a creative and independent research agenda, publish scholarly papers, and take on a mentorship role for undergraduate and graduate students at CCNY. </p>
